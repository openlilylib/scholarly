Welcome to scholarLY's documentation!
=====================================

-------

*scholarLY* is a project of openLilyLib, a collection of community resources
around GNU LilyPond music notation software. It provides a framework for extending
scores engraved by LilyPond with annotations, editorial functions, and a growing
number of other features. See the project on `Github`_ for the latest updates;
follow or contribute to the issue tracker there for feature requests and bug reports.

Currently, most openLilyLib projects' documentations are provided in the README's
which can be found on Github in the respective `repositories`_.
Since there currently isn't a manual for installing/using openLilyLib, this
version of scholarly's documentation includes a preamble *introduction to openLilyLib*
which explains the current state/functionality of OLL in general and, more importantly,
how to setup OLL on your system.

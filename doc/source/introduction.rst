**New to LilyPond?**

Each section (per *module*) of this manual begins with a compilable example that
you can use as a basis to follow along with the instructions. This means that
even with minimal experience with LilyPond, one should be able to grasp the
general concepts of scholarLY's functionality.

If this is your initial encounter with LilyPond, welcome to the Pond! The first
thing you'll probably notice about the software is that there is no GUI (graphical user
interface), meaning, foremost, a lack of point-and-click functionality. But fear not!
Every corner of LilyPond is extensively documented. Besides the `official manuals`_,
the `Scores of Beauty`_ blog often features posts which either clarify .. LilyPond
bla.. or present entirely new tools for extending LilyPond beyond its standard
capabilities. You can find many more resources such as mailing list archives and
other blogs scattered far across the internet.

**New to openLilyLib?**

Currently, most openLilyLib projects provide documentation in their README's
which can be found on Github in the respective `repositories`_. Since there
currently isn't a comprehensive manual for openLilyLib, this version of
scholarly's documentation includes an openLilyLib primer which explains the
current state/functionality of openLilyLib in general and specifically how to
setup its core utilities on your system as a prerequisite to other packages.

  \annotate - main file
  This file contains the "collector" and "processor" engravers for annotations
  and the interface music functions to enter annotations in LilyPond input files.
  TODO:
  - generate clickable links when writing to file
  - enable the music function to apply editorial functions
    to the affected grob (e.g. dashing slurs, parenthesizing etc.).
    This has to be controlled by extra annotation properties
    and be configurable to a high degree (this is a major task).
  - provide an infrastructure for custom annotation types
